# Welcome to MeshInspector
 MeshInspector is a versatile software designed for fast mesh repair, transforming 3D scans into solid models, and facilitating quality inspection. This all-in-one tool offers a modern, intuitive interface, ensuring efficient 3D data handling. It's lightning-fast, supports all platforms, and is browser-accessible. The MeshInspector supports 3D data types, like meshes, point clouds, CT scans, voxel data, distance maps, and polylines.

MeshInspector can be applied to 3D printing, scan to as-built models conversion GIS&BIM, digital dentistry, CT/ MRI scans to mesh transformation, and scan/CAD compare.

MeshInspector is built upon the robust open-source 3D mesh processing library MeshLib SDK. It is free from legacy code and is created using optimized and fast algorithms, which help achieve up to 2x faster data processing performance.

# MeshLib
[MeshLib](https://github.com/MeshInspector/MeshLib) is an Open-source 3D geometry library that enables you to seamlessly create powerful 3D applications and perform advanced operations with ease using either C++ or Python.

When designing MeshLib, we valued simplicity and performance while providing a wide gamut of useful computational algorithms. The library also supports the most important data structures today’s sensors can produce—point cloud, mesh, volume, and more. For example, a mesh is represented by a half-edge data structure and cannot be made non-manifold. Some applications may require non-manifoldness, but most practical scans can be represented as manifoldness meshes without an issue. 

## Features
[Overview](https://meshlib.meshinspector.com/features-meshlib/)
### Math basics
 - Math primitives and operations support (Vectors 2D, 3D, 4D; Lines; Planes; Bounding Boxes; Matrices; Affine transformations; Quaternions; Histograms; etc.)
### 3D data handling, creation, modification
 - 3D data various representations support: Mesh, Voxel and Point Cloud.
 - Data creation 
   - Mesh creation by given vertices and triangles,
   - Surface primitives (e.g. tor, cube, sphere, etc).
 - Representation conversions
   - Triangulation of a Point Cloud to Mesh,
   - Mesh to Cloud Point conversion,
   - Mesh to Voxel conversion,
   - Voxel To Mesh conversion.
 - Deformations
   - Laplacian deformation,
   - Freeform deformation,
   - Relax, mesh smoothing,
   - Position Verts Smoothly, arrangement of vertices in accordance with the gradient along the neighbors.
 - Offsets
   - Mesh offset, 
   - Mesh partial offset.
 - Resolution
   - Breaking a mesh into smaller triangles (increasing the resolution)
   - Mesh decimation (decreasing the number of triangles, decreasing the resolution) with a specified error relative to the old mesh.
 - Cutting a contour on a surface. The mesh is modified so that the resulting contour contains new edges cut through triangles at the specified points.
 - Splitting
   - Splitting mesh into sub-meshes (components)
### 3D data operations
 - Boolean ops (union, intersection, difference) 
   - Boolean ops on meshes via voxels. Efficient but not so accurate as explicit mesh operations.
   - Explicit mesh boolean ops, very exact, fast and accurate.
### 3D Data problems fixing
 - Fixing holes in the mesh
   - Holes stitching (removing two holes by stitching their boundaries) 
   - Hole filling,
   - Holes fixing metrics
      - Basic set of triangulation metrics,
      - Extended set of triangulation metrics,
      - Custom triangulation metrics.
 - Delaunay triangulation optimization, changing triangles without changing vertices, according to Delaunay criterion,
 - Tunnels fixing,
 - Multiple edges detection
 - Degenerate triangles fixing,
 - Undercuts fixing, via voxels, 
 - Surface self-intersections fixing
   - Guaranteed fix via voxels, 
   - Fix via Relax (mesh smoothing).
### Functions on 3D data
 - Projection
   - Projecting a point onto a mesh
 - Intersection
   - Intersection of a ray with a mesh,
   - Intersection of a plane with a mesh, result is a contour,
   - Finding a contour representing the intersection of two meshes, meshes remain unchanged,
 - Distance
   - Distance from a point to a mesh,
   - Minimal distance between two meshes,
   - Mesh distance map (height map),
   - 2D contour distance map.
 - Segmentation
