# MeshLib
[MeshLib](https://github.com/MeshInspector/MeshLib) is open source 3d procesing library.

The goal which we set when designing MeshLib was to value simplicity and performance while providing a wide gamut of useful computational algorithms. The library also supports the most important data structures todayâ€™s sensors can produce - pointcloud, mesh, volume and more. For example, mesh is represented by half-edge data structure and cannot be made non-manifold. Some applications may require non-manifoldness, but most practical scans can be represented as manifoldness meshes without an issue.
